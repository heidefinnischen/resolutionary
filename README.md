# Resolutionary
<h3>Calculate your screen's UI Resolution</h3>
<br>
Do you have a shiny new High-DPI laptop with billions of pixels? Your UI Scale is set to 350% and you would like to know what equivalent Low-DPI resolution that would be? Resolutionary allows you to enter your displays resolution and desired UI scaling and using simple python scripting out comes the resolution if your screen didn't have any of those extra pixels.

<h2> Info </h2>
Resolutionary is a simple app that basically calculates the logical resolution of the UI. On high resolution displays your scaling is likely to be something like 150%, 225%, or even higher. This means that while your display resolution might be 3840x2160 (or 4K) the content is scaled at 150% to be comfortable for viewing, which means your effective screen real estate is like a 2560x1440 display. You can enter any arbitrary resolution and scale starting at 100% and over, which helps especially with GNOME fractional scaling steps in 25% increments.

<h2> Made for the GNOME environment </h2>
Resolutionary is best experienced on the GNOME platform. It leverages core GNOME technologies and is adapted to the GNOME visual style basing on Libadwaita.

<h2> Thank you </h2>
This is my first shipped application and my very first GUI app. This project has helped me a great deal in understanding how the GNOME environment, including GNOME Builder, GTK4, libadwaita, Flatpack and many others work. I am still very much a beginner so please let me know about anything I can improve. Aside from that I also consider myself a beginner to coding in general. And thus the name Resolutionary.
