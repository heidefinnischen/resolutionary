Do you have a shiny new High-DPI laptop with billions of pixels? Your UI Scale is set to 350% and you would like to know what equivalent Low-DPI resolution that would be? Resolutionary allows you to enter your displays resolution and desired UI scaling and using simple python scripting out comes the resolution if your screen didn't have any of those extra pixels.

<h2> Info </h2>
Resolutionary is a simple app that basically calculates the logical resolution of the UI. On high resolution displays your scaling is likely to be something like 150%, 225%, or even higher. This means that while your display resolution might be 3840x2160 (or 4K) the content is scaled at 150% to be comfortable for viewing, which means your effective screen real estate is like on a 2560x1440 display. You can enter any arbitrary resolution and scale starting at 100% and over, which helps especially with GNOME fractional scaling steps in 25% increments.

<h2> Made for the GNOME environment </h2>
Resolutionary is best experienced on the GNOME platform. It leverages core GNOME technologies and is adapted to the GNOME visual style basing on Libadwaita.

<h2>Manifesto for simplicity</h2>
What warrants an app? How much code is needed to call something an app? Why do we call our “first hello world program” a program? Purpose makes an app.<br><br>

I know this app does just a simple calculation. I know this can be done by multiplying the width and height times the scale factor. I know it is basic.<br><br>
Yet it doesnt matter what's under the hood. When I'm using a program I dont care how complicated the codebase is. I dont look at the source code of the app I'm using just to make sure it's not basic. When I'm calculating something important, sometimes I put simple math like 12+5 into my calculator. Not because I can't do mental math. It's to be sure. When it's really important to get things right. I'm sure a lot of us do that. GUI apps give security. You can trust the application because it guides you.<br><br>
There's all kinds of calculators online. There are calculators that let you convert two lengths into an area. Why dont people just put x*y in a calculator? Why do people use these websites and apps? And in most unit conversion tools you can convert meters into centimeters. Why do these apps offer that? Why do we use calculator apps if we could just enter the numbers in a terminal? This is the same conversation we've had over 40 years ago when people questioned the graphical interface in general. User-friendliness should not be underestimated.<br><br>

It does not matter if the app is simple. What matters is if it's a polished experience. What matters is if people will use it and get something out of it.<br><br>
Even if its just 4 lines of code. It's wrapped in a visually pleasing, approachable UI inviting them to do their calculation — and yes, I know I am talking about a scaled UI resolution calculator.

<h2> Thank you </h2>
The app code is very basic by design as this is my first shipped application and my very first GUI app. The building of this application was testing and learning about GUI app creation. This project has helped me a great deal in understanding how the GNOME environment, including GNOME Builder, GTK4, libadwaita, Flatpak and many others work. Yet there is still so much to learn so please let me know about anything I can improve on. Aside from that I also consider myself a beginner to coding in general. And thus the name Resolutionary.
